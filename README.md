RunKeeper.js (`runkeeper-js`) - RunKeeper HealthGraph API Client Library for Node.js
==============================================================

This is an API Client and Wrapper for the [RunKeeper Health Graph API](http://developer.runkeeper.com/healthgraph) in active development and maintained on NPM. It is based on `node-runkeeper` (see Contributors for more info).

## Installation

- `runkeeper-js` is available on NPM and maintained in sync with this Github branch. Just include it in your dependencies via `package.json` and `npm install` in your app's root directory to install it in your `node_modules` directory.

## Creating a client

Register your application with RunKeeper to get the credentials needed for your client options: [http://runkeeper.com/partner/applications](http://runkeeper.com/partner/applications)

```javascript

// Set up your client's options
var options = exports.options = {

    // Client ID (Required): 
    // This value is the OAuth 2.0 client ID for your application.  
    client_id : "< client id >",

    // Client Secret (Required):  
    // This value is the OAuth 2.0 shared secret for your application.   
    client_secret : "< client secret >",
    
    // Authorization URL (Optional, default will work for most apps):
    // This is the URL to which your application should redirect the user in order to authorize access to his or her RunKeeper account.   
    auth_url : "https://runkeeper.com/apps/authorize",

    // Access Token URL (Optional, default will work for most apps):
    // This is the URL at which your application can convert an authorization code to an access token. 
    access_token_url : "https://runkeeper.com/apps/token",

    // Redirect URI (Optional but defaults to null, which means your app won't be able to use the getNewToken method):
    // This is the URL that RK sends user to after successful auth  
    // URI naming based on Runkeeper convention 
    redirect_uri : "< redirect uri >",
    
    // Access Token (Optional, defaults to null):
    // When doing Client API Calls on behalf of a specific user (and not getting a new Access Token for the first time), set the user's Access Token here.
    access_token : "< access token >",

    // API Domain (Optional, default will work for most apps):
    // This is the FQDN (Fully qualified domain name) that is used in making API calls
    api_domain : "api.runkeeper.com"
};

// Require RunKeeper.js
var Runkeeper = require('runkeeper-js');

// Create a Client
var client = new Runkeeper(options);

```

## Using the client

Using any of the client's API methods assumes that it has a valid access_token except for the getNewToken method. In order to perform API calls on behalf of a user, you first need to get their access token

```javascript
// Get a new Access Token with your Client
client.getNewToken(authorization_code, function(err, access_token) {

	// If an error occurred during the Access Token request, handle it. For the example, we'll just output it and return false.
	if(err) { console.log(err); return false; }

	// Set the client's Access Token. Any future API Calls will be performed using the authorized user's access token. 
	client.access_token = access_token;
	
	// Usually, you'll want to store the access_token for later use so that you can set it upon initialization of the Client
	
	// Example: Get user's Profile information
	client.apiCall({ resource: 'profile' }, function(err, reply) {
		if(err) { console.log(err); }
		
		// Do whatever you need with the API's reply.
		console.log(reply);
	});
})
```

## Extending the client

Several Predefined API Calls are available to the Client in addition to the Generic API Call function; these are defined in the API object, as seen below.

```javascript
var API = exports.API = {
    "user": {"media_type": "application/vnd.com.runkeeper.User+json",
             "uri": "/user"},
    "profile": {"media_type": "application/vnd.com.runkeeper.Profile+json",
                "uri": "/profile"},
    "settings": {"media_type": "application/vnd.com.runkeeper.Settings+json",
                "uri": "/settings"},
    "fitnessActivityFeed": {"media_type": "application/vnd.com.runkeeper.FitnessActivityFeed+json",
                "uri": "/fitnessActivities"},
    "fitnessActivities": {"media_type": "application/vnd.com.runkeeper.FitnessActivity+json",
                "uri": "/fitnessActivities"},
};
```
